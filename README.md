# Authentication-App
Simple web authentication app

I developed this project utilizing mysql, apache, laravel, and phpmyadmin. You can run this website using laravel's artisan server on your machine.

Before you get this website up and running you need to make a few changes in the .env variable:

1. Specify your db host, name, and credentials.
2. Specify the mail driver and also your credentials for using that driver.
